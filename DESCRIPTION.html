This addon lets you edit your card during review. You can add clozes, images, LaTeX expressions, highlight text, and most things you can do in the editor.
To edit a field, click on a field while pressing Ctrl. (Cmd on mac)

<b>After installing, additional work is required to make the fields editable.</b>
Open the addon config and go to the "Fields" tab. You can select the fields of note types you want to edit in the reviewer.

Doing this edits the note type template so {{Field}} becomes {{edit:Field}}. You can do this manually as well. Whenever you add a new note type, you will need to make them editable with the above method.
